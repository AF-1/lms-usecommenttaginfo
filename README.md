Use Comment Tag Info
====

A plugin for [Logitech Media Server](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver)<br>

**This plugin uses (key)words in your music files' <u>comment tags</u> to:**<br>
- **add extra information to the song details page**,<br>
- **define and display custom title formats**,<br>
- **create virtual libraries with browse menus(*)**,<br>
- skip songs with CustomSkip.
<br>

(*) Browse menus are provided by LMS. Under certain circumstances you may see (empty) albums or artists in some menus that shouldn't be there. There's nothing I can do about it because LMS creates and provides these menus. Just go down one level: click to show all tracks/albums.

More information and instructions on the plugin's setting page.
