Use Comment Tag Info
====

A plugin for [Logitech Media Server](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver)<br>

**This plugin allows you to include extra information in the LMS song details information page.**

If it finds any of the (key)words you set in a track's comment tag it displays strings of your choice on the song details information page in the way you choose.
<br><br>

**Example:**

You would like to include the **record label** of your tracks in the *song detail information page*.<br>
Add words like EMI, DG or Stax to your comment tags. Then set the *Search String* to any of those words, set the *Menu Item Name* to "Record label" and the *Displayed Item String* to the full name of the record label.<br>

**Result:**<br>
Record label: EMI
